.SH DESCRIPTION
SAPHanaSrTakeoverBlocker.py can be used to provide a script for the SAP HANA srHook method srConnectionChanged().

The SAP HANA nameserver provides a Python-based API ("HA/DR providers"), which 
is called at important points of the host auto-failover and system replication 
takeover process. These so called hooks can be used for arbitrary operations that
need to be executed. The method srConnectionChanged() is called on the master
nameserver as soon as one of the replicating services loses or establishes
the system replication connection. This method is called only once.

.\"TODO to block sr_takeover if resource is not in maintenance

.SH REQUIREMENTS 
1. SAP HANA 2.0 SPS04 or later provides the HA/DR provider hook method
srConnectionChanegd() with multi-target aware parameters.
SAP HANA 1.0 does not provide them.
The multi-target aware parameters are needed for the SAPHanaSR scale-up
package.
.PP
2. The user ${sid}adm needs execution permission as user root for the command 
TODO. 
.PP
3. The hook provider needs to be added to the HANA global configuration,
in memory and on disk (in persistence).
.PP
4. If the hook provider should be pre-compiled, the particular Python version
that comes with SAP HANA has to be used.
